Hello, and welcome to my corner of the web at [blog.naol.dev](https://blog.naol.dev/). I'm Naol Mengistu, a cybersecurity professional. This website is where I document my hands-on projects in digital forensics, cloud security, and automated GRC, turning theory into practical code and analysis.

In our rapidly evolving digital world, itâ€™s not enough to just deploy technology. We must build systems that are not only functional but also resilient, secure, and compliant by design. 

### My Journey: From Tech Support to Security Strategy

My journey began with a foundational curiosity for how things work, leading me to a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My early career in technical support and quality analysis gave me a unique, ground-level perspective. I learned that the biggest challenges weren't always purely technical; they were often rooted in human processes, communication gaps, and a misunderstanding of risk.

This experience sparked a desire to look at the bigger picture. I didn't just want to fix problems; I wanted to prevent them. This ambition led me to pursue a Master's degree in Information Security at Stockholm University, where I could dive deep into the principles of building secure systems from the ground up.

This path, which has taken me from Ethiopia to Poland and now to Sweden, has taught me that security is a universal language, but its application requires understanding diverse contexts, a skill I strive to bring to every project.

### My Core Areas of Focus

I focus my energy on three interconnected pillars of modern cybersecurity:

1.  **Automated Governance & Compliance:** I am fascinated by the "Compliance-as-Code" movement. My Master's thesis involved building a Python-based tool to automatically scan an AWS environment for misconfigurations and map them directly to the DORA regulation. I believe the future of GRC lies in proactive, automated, and continuous verification, using frameworks like **ISO 27001**, **NIST**, and regulations like **DORA** and **NIS2** as our guide.

2.  **Practical Security Operations (SecOps):** Theory is essential, but hands-on skill is non-negotiable. I maintain a personal **SOC home lab** where I use **Splunk** to practice threat hunting, log analysis, and incident response. I also run an **Active Directory lab** to hone my skills in system administration and access control. This is where I test my knowledge and stay sharp.

3.  **The Human Element of Security:** My background in quality analysis taught me that technology is only half the battle. A security policy is only as good as its adoption. I am deeply interested in how we design security systems and processes that people can actually use, systems that are intuitive, effective, and foster a culture of shared security responsibility.

### My Philosophy

My approach to my work is guided by a few core beliefs:

-   **Building is the Best Way to Learn:** Whether it's a compliance scanner, a SOC lab, or this very website, I believe that the act of building solidifies knowledge like nothing else.
-   **Curiosity is a Superpower:** I am constantly exploring new areas, from the intricacies of cloud security to the potential of applying AI/ML to threat detection.
-   **Communication is the Ultimate Bridge:** The most brilliant technical solution is useless if it can't be explained to business leaders or understood by its users. I strive to be a translator who can speak to developers, management, and compliance officers with equal clarity.

### Let's Connect

This blog is where I share my projects, tutorials, and thoughts on the evolving landscape of cybersecurity. I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborating on projects, or simply connecting with fellow professionals.
