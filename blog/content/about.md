In today‚Äôs digital landscape, security must be built in  not bolted on. Systems need to be secure, functional, and adaptable by design.

### My Journey: From Tech Support to Security Strategy

My path started with a deep curiosity about how systems work, leading to a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science. Early roles in tech support and quality analysis grounded me in the human side of technology, where I learned that many problems stem from communication gaps and unclear processes  not just broken code.

That insight drove me to zoom out and think bigger. I pursued a Master‚Äôs in Information Security at Stockholm University to learn how to build secure systems from the ground up. Along the way, my journey has taken me from Ethiopia to Poland and now to Sweden  reinforcing my belief that while security is global, its context is always local.

### My Focus Areas

I concentrate on three core pillars of modern cybersecurity:

1. **Automated Governance & Compliance**  
   I‚Äôm an advocate of the ‚ÄúCompliance-as-Code‚Äù movement. My Master‚Äôs thesis involved developing a Python-based AWS security scanner that maps cloud misconfigurations to the **DORA** regulation. I believe the future of GRC lies in automation, proactive detection, and continuous verification  guided by frameworks like **ISO 27001**, **NIST**, and evolving regulations such as **DORA** and **NIS2**.

2. **Practical Security Operations (SecOps)**  
   I maintain a home **SOC lab** where I use **Splunk** for log analysis, threat hunting, and incident response. I also run an **Active Directory lab** for system administration and access control practice. These labs are where I refine my skills and test real-world scenarios.

3. **The Human Element of Security**  
   Tools are only part of the equation. My experience in QA taught me that secure systems must also be usable. I care about designing processes and controls that align with how people work, promoting security awareness and shared responsibility.

### My Philosophy

- **Build to Learn:** Whether it's a compliance scanner, a SOC lab, or this blog  building is how I deepen understanding.
- **Stay Curious:** From cloud security to AI-enhanced detection, I‚Äôm always exploring new angles.
- **Communicate Clearly:** A secure solution must be understood by both developers and decision-makers. I aim to bridge that gap.
